# Project Overview

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the **cloud**. Their data resides in **S3**, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that 

1. extracts the data (format=JSON) from S3, 
2. process the data with **Spark** , 
3. load the data back to S3 (format=Parquet) as a set of dimensional tables. 

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

# Dataset

You'll be working with two datasets that reside in **S3** with the following link:

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`

- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

    

## Song Data

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```txt
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## Log Data

The log data are in JSON format files generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. The log files are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:

```txt
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like:

# Project Development

The project is developed in a **local enviornment (MacOS)** and based on libraries including `pyspark` `spark.jars.packages`, and `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:2.7.0`. 

## Overview of the steps

1. On **AWS console**, create **IAM user**
    * save the access key and secrete in `dl.cfg`
2. On **AWS console**, create a **S3 bucket**
    * The name of my S3 bucket is `aws-emr-resources-327442518701-us-west-2`
    * The output from this project will be saved in the subfolder `s3a://aws-emr-resources-327442518701-us-west-2/datalakes-project/`
3. Test the pipeline with **local data**, to check the correctness of codes:
    1. Run `etl_local.py test` on *one song file and one log file*
    2. Run `etl_local.py full` on full data downloaded from udacity workspace
4. Run the pipeline with **data stored in S3**, either
    * Run `etl.py` locally (very slow, the speed is limited by Internet data transfer Internet between different regions) OR
    * Run `etl.py` on an **emr cluster**

## Files

* `etl_local.py`: pipeline for data stored on S3 `s3://udacity-dend/`
* `etl.py`: pipeline for test data downloaded from project workspace and stored locally on `/Users/hetianlin/OneDrive/GitHub/data_lakes_with_Spark/data/`
* `sample_dl.cfg` is a copy of `dl.cfg` without  **key and secret**, becuase they ought NOT to be accessible to the public

## Test on local data

```bash
python etl_local.py full
```
